# ScreenChangeScript

# Automatic Screen Mode Switching Based on Power State

## Objective:
Develop a Python script that **automatically switches** the display mode between **"PC Screen Only"** and **"Extend Screen"** based on the **charging status** of a laptop or desktop. The script should run in the background without user intervention.

## Problem Description:
Users who work with **multiple monitors** often face situations where their external display setup is disrupted when **power is disconnected**. Manually changing display settings every time is inconvenient.

To solve this, the system should:
- **Detect power status changes** in real-time.
- **Automatically switch to "PC Screen Only"** when charging is disconnected.
- **Wait for 5 seconds and switch to "Extend Screen"** when charging is reconnected.
- **Run silently in the background** using Task Scheduler.

## Expected Outcome:
- The script will **seamlessly adjust** screen modes, enhancing productivity.
- Users will **not need to manually change display settings** each time power status changes.
- The program will run **automatically on startup** via Task Scheduler.

## How to Use:
1. Run the script manually or schedule it via Task Scheduler.
2. The script will detect charging status and adjust screen mode accordingly.

## ðŸ”§ Setup Guide: Running the Script Automatically

### **Step 1: Create a Batch File**
1. Open **Notepad** and paste the following code:

   ```batch
   @echo off
   pythonw "C:\path\to\your\script\screen_switch.py"

2. Replace C:\path\to\your\script\screen_switch.py with the actual path to your Python script.

3. Click File â†’ Save As.

4. Choose "All Files" as file type.

5. Name it screen_switch.bat.

6. Save it in a location like C:\scripts\.


### **Step 2: Add to Task Scheduler**
1. Open Task Scheduler (Win + R â†’ Type taskschd.msc â†’ Press Enter).

2. Click "Create Basic Task" (Right panel).

3. Name it "Screen Switch Automation".

4. Click Next, select "When the computer starts", and click Next.

5. Choose "Start a Program" and click Next.

6. Browse and select the screen_switch.bat file.

7. Click Finish.

### **Step 3: Verify the Task**
  - Restart your PC and check if the script runs automatically.  
    OR
  - If it doesn't, open Task Scheduler, find the task, right-click, and select Run to test it.
